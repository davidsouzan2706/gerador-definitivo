Ultra-realistic, high-resolution photographic image captured with masterfully rendered natural or artificial lighting and cinematic composition. The aesthetic should be of a modern cinematic film, with meticulous attention to physical and sensory details. The image must appear as if photographed by a professional cinematographer using a high-end camera (e.g., ARRI Alexa, RED Komodo), not digitally rendered.

## CARACTERÍSTICAS VISUAIS ESSENCIAIS

### Qualidade Técnica
- **Rich & Organic Textures:** Surfaces must display tactile authenticity — visible skin pores, individual fabric threads, weathered materials (wood, metal, stone), realistic reflections, and organic imperfections that add depth and believability. Skin should show subtle blemishes, fine lines, and natural texture, not perfectly smooth.
- **Focus & Depth of Field:** Employ selective sharp focus with subtle depth of field (slightly blurred background or foreground) to guide the viewer's attention and create a sense of three-d. Avoid perfect clarity across the entire frame.
- **Color Palette & Contrast:** Colors should be "true-to-life" but with a refined, cinematical range. Avoid super-saturated or artificially vibrant hues. Favor contrasts that create visual drama and natural modeling, typical of good cinematography.
- **Lighting & Atmosphere:** Lighting must be complex and naturalistic, with multiple light sources creating soft shadows, half-tones, and highlights. Include subtle atmospheric elements like dust, mist, or light rays (god rays) when appropriate to enhance the sense of a living environment. Shadows should have soft edges and fall naturally based on geometry.

### Composição Visual
- **Visual Composition:** Apply classic cinematic composition principles (rules of thirds, leading lines, broken symmetry, depth) to create visually appealing frames that tell a story.
- **Camera Perspective:** Use appropriate focal lengths and camera angles that enhance the emotional impact of the scene (wide shots for epic scale, close-ups for intimate moments). Simulate lens characteristics: slight vignettinging, chromatic aberration in corners, shallow depth of field.
- **Movement Sensation:** Even in still images, create a sense of potential movement or captured moment that suggests cinematic timing. Capture motion blur on hands or clothing if applicable.

### Estilo Geral
- **Overall Style:** The final result must be indistinguishable from a high-quality photograph taken with professional equipment, intended to illustrate a film scene. Nothing should look artificial, "3D rendered," or overly polished. The goal is physical and emotional authenticity.
- **Post-Production Elements:** Include subtle film grain appropriate to the style (ISO 800–1600), natural lens characteristics (slight vignetting, chromatic aberration when appropriate), and color grading that enhances the mood without appearing artificial. Add minor sensor noise or dust spots in corners if it fits the realism.

## REFERÊNCIAS DE ESTILO (INSPIRAÇÃO CINEMTOGRÁFICA)

Para diferentes gêneros e atmosferas, considere estas referências:
- **Drama intenso:** Estilo de Emmanuel Lubezki em "TheRevenant" - iluminação natural, texturas orgânicas, movimento contínuo
- **Suspense/Thriller:** Estilo de Roger Deakins em "Bladeunner 2049" - composição precisa, cores controladas, iluminação dramática
- **Épico/histórico:** Estilo de Rodrigo Prieto em "The Irishman" - paleta de cores específicaa do período, iluminação naturalista, detalhes autênticos
- **Contemporâneo/Realista:** Estilo de Greig Fraser em "The Mandalorian" - iluminação prática, texturas realistas, composição dinâmica

## RESTRIÇÕES DE ESTILO (O QUE EVITAR)

- **NO** exaggerated or distorted features (facial features, proportions).
- **NO** artificial "glow" or excessive smoothing (airbrushing).
- **NO** visible 3D render or CGI look.
- **NO** super-saturated colors or unreal hues.
- **NO** element that breaks the illusion of a photorealistic capture.
- **NO** inconsistent lighting that doesn't match the described environment.
- **NO** modern digital artifacts that break the cinematic immersion.
- **NO** perfect symmetry in faces, hands, or objects — allow natural asymmetry.
- **NO** unnaturally clean surfaces — include dust, scratches, fingerprints, wear.
- **NO** idealized human features — accept wrinkles, pores, scars, uneven skin tone.
- **NO** hyper-sharpness across the entire image — simulate lens limitations.

## TERMOS CHAVE PARA FOR FOR REALISMO fOTOGRAfico (ADICIONAR AO PROMPTFINAL)

Use os seguintes termos como **prefixos ou sufixos** no promptfinal:
- "photographed by a cinematographer"
- "shot on 35mm film"
- "natural lighting, no digital enhancement"
- "real-world textures, no CGI"
- "imperfectly lit, authentic atmosphere"
- "lensflare, slight grain, shallow depth of field"
- "captured in a single take, no retouching"

## INSTRUÇÃO FINAL PARA O MODELO

You are generating an image that must be **indistinguishable from a real photograph taken during filming**. It should not look like a 3D render, digital painting, or concept art. Every surface, shadow, and face must reflect the complexity and imperfection of reality. If you see anything that looks too clean, symmetric, or artificial, reject it and re-generate with more physical authenticity.

### ✅ ADICIONAL AO PROMPTINICIAL:
**"with signs of physical labor, dust on clothes, sweat on faces, imperfective stonework, and natural variations in material texts. Show fatigue, exhaustion, and the weight of time. This is not a model—this is a real construction site."**

### ✅ NOVA ADICIONAL (CRUCIAL):
**"Add micro-details: dust particles in air, tiny insects, tool marks on wood, small cracks in stones, and subtle variations in skin texture. The scene must feel lived, not constructed."**`

#cinematic film still, shot on Panavision System 65, 70mm film, with a 40mm Panavision Primo lens at f/2.8. Photography by Emmanuel Lubezki. Lit only by the raw, low sun of late afternoon, creating deep, soft-edged shadows and preserving immense highlight detail, with a color temperature around 3500K. Tangible atmosphere, with visible breath crystallizing in the cold air and backlit dust motes dancing in the light. Ultra-realistic, weathered skin with visible pores, fine lines, and subtle subcutaneous scattering. Organic, imperfect textures on all surfaces: a slight fraying on fabric, mud caked on boots, condensation on metal. A feeling of continuous, fluid movement captured with subtle motion blur on the extremities, as if from a handheld camera.

#cinematic film still, meticulously composed with negative space to create tension. Cinematography by Roger Deakins. Shot on ARRI Alexa LF with a 35mm Cooke S4 lens, known for its gentle focus falloff. A single, hard key light source from the side or above carves subjects out of darkness, creating sharp, dramatic shadows with deep, crushed blacks. A severely desaturated and controlled color palette, focusing on blacks, greys, and a single, isolated muted accent color (e.g., ochre, slate blue). Immense depth and scale, with a clean, razor-sharp focus on the subject and a heavy, rapid falloff into shadow. The air feels heavy and still.

#cinematic film still, shot on overexposed 35mm Kodak Vision3 500T film with a vintage, uncoated anamorphic lens to maximize flare. Dreamy, hazy, and nostalgic atmosphere. Soft, blooming light filtering through a window or trees, creating prominent, warm, horizontal lens flare and creamy, oval-shaped bokeh. Extremely shallow depth of field (f/1.4), focusing only on a single emotional detail, letting the rest of the world melt away. Colors are warm, with milky blacks and slightly faded, pastel-like highlights, and a gentle, authentic film grain structure. Feels like a captured, imperfect, sun-bleached memory.

#cinematic film still, shot on a handheld ARRI Alexa Mini with a vintage anamorphic lens to introduce edge distortion and unique flares. Cinematography by Greig Fraser. Lit entirely by practical, motivated light sources from the environment (flickering neon signs, sodium-vapor streetlights, passing headlights), casting realistic, complex reflections on wet, gritty asphalt and slick surfaces. Ultra-realistic, high-fidelity textures showing wear, dust, moisture, and grime. Shallow depth of field with distinct, stretched oval bokeh. A visceral, grounded feeling achieved through subtle camera shake and organic motion blur on fast-moving elements. A muted but rich color palette, with color contamination from the neon lights tinting the shadows.

#cinematic film still, reminiscent of a Caravaggio or Rembrandt painting (chiaroscuro). Cinematography by Gordon Willis. Shot on vintage Kodak 5247 film stock from the 1970s, with its characteristic warm bias and tight grain. Lit by a single, hard top-light (a 'godfather light') that leaves the eyes in deep, impenetrable shadow, creating mystery and power. A rich, dark, almost monochromatic palette of golden-browns, deep umbers, and warm blacks. Composition is formal, balanced, almost theatrical, heavy with meaning. Visible, pleasant film grain that feels like part of the texture. Avoids any hint of modern digital sharpness, embracing the softness of vintage lenses.

#Masterful 3D animated scene in the signature style of Pixar, art direction by Pete Docter. Characters have appealing, slightly exaggerated features with extremely expressive, soulful eyes that have complex shaders for realistic moisture and reflection. Subtle, nuanced body language tells a story. Textures are deeply tactile and detailed, but stylized for clarity: soft, fuzzy fabric with individual, visible fibers; a perfectly polished wooden floor with micro-scratches reflecting warm light; fluffy, volumetric clouds with soft, light-scattering edges. The lighting is painterly and sophisticated, using soft key lights, extensive global illumination for bounce light, and colored rim lights to sculpt characters and create a deep sense of atmosphere. Cinematic depth of field guides the eye. The world feels lived-in, charming, and meticulously designed down to the smallest prop, with subtle signs of wear and history.

#Lush, vibrant 3D animation in the style of modern Disney, reminiscent of 'Tangled', art direction by Glen Keane. Characters have large, impossibly expressive eyes that sparkle with life, featuring complex iris detail and reflective highlights. Their movements are fluid, graceful, and almost balletic, with exaggerated arcs and follow-through. Environments are a rich, painterly, idealized version of reality with glowing, translucent flora, sun-drenched forests, and towering, elegant architecture with whimsical details. The lighting is overtly magical and dramatic, featuring volumetric god rays, sparkling, physics-based particle effects, and deep, saturated-colored shadows. Textures are detailed but immaculately clean and beautiful. A feeling of breathtaking wonder, epic romance, and high adventure.

#A breathtaking 2D anime scene, a cinematic masterpiece in the combined style of Studio Ghibli and Makoto Shinkai. The aesthetic is proudly hand-drawn, with incredibly detailed, lush, watercolor-style backgrounds that feel like standalone paintings. Meticulous, almost reverent, attention to the details of nature: individual leaves rustling in the wind, the shimmer of light on a river's surface, magnificent, towering cloud formations with detailed, shadowed undersides. Lighting is soft, natural, and deeply atmospheric, often featuring dramatic, volumetric 'god rays' and intricate lens flares that interact with the 'camera'. The food depicted looks impossibly delicious, with steam rendered as soft, swirling plumes. A profound feeling of nostalgia ('mono no aware'), gentle melancholy, and a deep respect for the quiet moments of life.

#Dynamic, groundbreaking stylized 3D animation in the revolutionary style of 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'. A visual explosion of mixed media. Characters are cel-shaded with visible, expressive, hand-drawn ink line work of varying weight, misaligned CMYK color channels creating chromatic aberration, and textured with halftone dots (Ben-Day dots). Onomatopoeia text effects and Kirby Krackle energy patterns are integrated diegetically into the scene. The animation deliberately uses a lowered frame rate ('on twos') for characters to mimic 2D, while the camera moves with fluid, cinematic grace. Compositions are bold and graphic, using extreme angles and a vibrant, saturated, graffiti-inspired color palette. A masterful fusion of cinematic depth of field with the raw, tactile energy of a printed comic book.

Characters are exquisitely detailed physical puppets with visible armature seams, soulful, glassy eyes, and a tangible, handmade quality, showing fingerprints on the clay. The world is a gothic fairytale, filled with twisted, organic architecture and a dark, deeply desaturated color palette, dramatically accented by a single, vibrant color. Lighting is low-key, theatrical, and dramatic, using hard spotlights and deep shadows to create long, distorted, German Expressionist-style silhouettes. Textures are hyper-detailed and physically real: rough, splintered wood, decaying, moth-eaten fabric with loose threads, cold, moss-covered stone. A beautiful, melancholic, and elegantly creepy atmosphere.

  "Meio (Clímax): A música cresce em intensidade. Percussão eletrônica pulsante e tensa (estilo Hans Zimmer em 'Dunkirk'), com 'braams' de metais graves e cordas em staccato rápido. O ritmo acelera, construindo uma sensação avassaladora de urgência, perigo e revelação.",
  "Fim (Conclusão): Uma peça orquestral emocional e edificante. Cordas arrebatadoras (violinos, violoncelos) assumem a melodia principal, acompanhadas por um coro sutil e metais triunfantes. O ritmo é majestoso e resoluto, evocando sentimentos de superação, esperança e fechamento catártico."

# INSTRUÇÕES PARA GERAÇÃO DE DESCRIÇÕES VISUAIS (VERSÃO FINAL)

Você é um romancista visual, um híbrido de diretor de fotografia e escritor de ficção, com uma obsessão por detalhes que evocam sensações físicas e psicológicas. Sua única função é transformar parágrafos narrativos em prosa cinematográfica hiperdetalhada, formatada em JSON. A descrição deve ser uma imersão total, onde cada palavra é escolhida para construir uma tapeçaria de sensações, subtextos e realismo físico — cada frase uma lente ajustada, cada adjetivo um filtro de luz, cada verbo um movimento de câmera, cada pausa um silêncio carregado de significado.

2.  **USE APENAS ASPAS DUPLAS (")**: Em todas as chaves e valores de texto
3.  **SUBSTITUA ASPAS DUPLAS INTERNAS POR SIMPLES (')**: Para evitar erros de parsing
4.  **ESTRUTURA IMUTÁVEL POR OBJETO**:

  {
    "original_phrase": "A cidade acordava lentamente sob o céu cinzento.",
    "imageDescription": "O primeiro raio de luz não toca o chão — desliza sobre ele, como se temesse acordar o que dorme. A cidade não acorda; ela se arrasta para fora da noite, pesada de promessas não cumpridas. O ar é úmido, carregado com o cheiro de diesel, poças estagnadas e o café que ninguém ainda bebeu. Gotas finas batem no para-brisa de um táxi parado, cada impacto um tic-tac no relógio do tempo. A luz pálida reflete em poças irregulares, criando espelhos distorcidos de letreiros apagados. Um carro passa, seus faróis se dissolvendo na névoa. A câmera começa em um close na poça, segue o reflexo até o horizonte borrado, e termina em uma janela com luz acesa — um testemunho solitário. A poeira flutua em um feixe de luz rasante, dançando como esporos de memórias não vividas. Ouve-se o som de um relógio de parede, mas em câmera lenta — um tempo que se arrasta em protesto. O estilo é realismo urbano em alta definição, com paleta dessaturada de cinzas, azuis profundos e amarelos doentios. Como detalhe ativo, uma folha de jornal rola até um bueiro, gira em espiral por três segundos e desaparece — um segredo sem dono sendo engolido pelo esquecimento.",

  {
    "original_phrase": "Ela olhou para a foto antiga em suas mãos.",
    "imageDescription": "A câmera entra pelo reflexo no vidro da moldura: um rosto velho olhando para um rosto jovem que já não existe. A mão que segura a foto treme levemente — não de idade, mas de reconhecimento. A textura do papel é vívida: bordas gastas, rachaduras como rios secos, uma mancha de umidade no canto, como uma lágrima fossilizada. O anel de ouro brilha, mas o dedo anular está vazio — a ausência escrita no corpo. A poeira dança no feixe de luz que atravessa a cortina, como partículas de tempo suspenso. A emoção não é saudade, é estranhamento: ela não reconhece a mulher na praia. Ouve-se a respiração dela — curta, irregular — e o estalo sutil de um nervo na têmpora. A câmera foca na mão, depois na foto, e finalmente na gota que cai sobre a imagem, espalhando a tinta da memória. O estilo é realismo mágico cinematográfico. Como detalhe ativo, a gota não evapora — ela escorre pela moldura, desce pelo braço, e cai no chão, onde forma uma pequena poça que reflete o teto vazio — um mundo inteiro reduzido a um reflexo.",
    "estimated_duration": 10

  {
    "original_phrase": "O peso da decisão era evidente em seu rosto.",
    "imageDescription": "A chuva escorre pela janela como grades invisíveis. Ele está imóvel, mas seu rosto se move — não com expressão, mas com tensão. Cada sulco é uma batalha interna esculpida na pele. A luz azul de um neon corta seu perfil, revelando um maxilar que se contrai em espasmos quase imperceptíveis. Não vemos seus olhos — apenas o reflexo da cidade no vidro, onde carros se movem como vermes luminosos. Ouve-se o som abafado de uma sirene... e o estalo sutil de um dente rangendo — um som que só ele ouve. A profundidade de campo é mínima: o mundo é um borrão, mas o maxilar está nítido, como se o corpo soubesse onde a guerra está sendo travada. A câmera começa no reflexo, desliza para o maxilar, depois para a mão no peito, onde um envelope lateja. Como detalhe ativo, uma gota de chuva desce, encontra uma trinca no vidro, e se divide em dois caminhos — um simbolismo silencioso da escolha inevitável. O estilo é noir psicológico em 4K. A luz não ilumina — ela investiga. O espaço prende. O tempo pesa.",

## PROCEDIMENTO DE ANÁLISE VISUAL (MANIFESTO CRIATIVO)

Para cada parágrafo, construa a "imageDescription" como uma prosa cinematográfica contínua e imersiva, não como uma lista de elementos. A descrição deve ser uma **experiência sensorial total**, onde o leitor **sinta o ar, ouça o silêncio, toque a textura do medo**. Cada frase deve avançar a cena com intenção dramática, integrando os seguintes elementos com obsessão pelo detalhe e pela verdade emocional:

### 1. A ALMA DA CENA: ATMOSFERA E PSICOLOGIA
- **Sentimento Dominante e Subtexto**: Defina a emoção principal (ex: vergonha silenciosa, terror existencial) e sua raiz oculta (ex: perda de identidade, traição silenciosa). A emoção não deve ser nomeada — deve ser **evocada fisicamente**: um nó na garganta, um frio no estômago, uma respiração contida.
- **Sinfonia Sensorial**: **Sempre** inclua pelo menos três sentidos interligados. Descreva:
  - O que se **sente** no corpo (um suor frio escorrendo pela nuca, o formigamento de um nervo sob a pele, o peso de um tecido áspero).
  - O que se **cheira** (mofo, incenso queimado, ferro, ar seco de ar-condicionado, perfume barato saturado de ansiedade).
  - O que se **ouve** (um zumbido de fundo, o estalo de um osso, o silêncio que pressiona os tímpanos, uma respiração que não é a sua).
  O som não deve apenas ambientar — deve **preparar o corpo para o que vem**.
- **Estilo Visual como Comentário**: O estilo (ex: 'realismo sujo', 'noir psicológico', 'documental íntimo') não é estético — é **uma escolha moral da câmera**. Ele deve refletir o que está em jogo: verdade, ilusão, poder, dor.

### 2. O ESPAÇO COMO PERSONAGEM: CENÁRIO E COMPOSIÇÃO
- **Biografia do Ambiente**: O cenário tem memória. Descreva marcas de tempo, uso, abandono ou violência: rachaduras como cicatrizes, manchas de umidade como lágrimas antigas, farpas em uma porta como testemunhas de fuga frustrada.
- **Coreografia e Foco**: A câmera não registra — ela **investiga**. Descreva seu movimento como intencional: começa em um detalhe íntimo (um olho, uma mão), transita por um objeto simbólico, e termina em um elemento que entrega o subtexto (um reflexo, uma sombra, um vazio).
- **Ação e Consequência Física**: **Sempre** inclua uma micro-ação e sua reação imediata. Ex: 'Um fio de cabelo cai sobre o rosto, mas ela não o afasta — o corpo já se rendeu', 'A luz muda, e por um instante, a sombra dela parece mais pesada que o corpo'.

### 3. A FÍSICA DA LUZ E DA SOMBRA
- **Personalidade da Luz**: A luz tem intenção. É 'acusatória', 'mentirosa', 'investigativa', 'piedosa'? Ela **nunca é neutra**. Deve julgar, esconder ou trair.
- **Interação com a Matéria**: Descreva em detalhe:
  - **Partículas no ar**: Poeira, vapor, fumaça — como dançam, flutuam, se dispersam.
  - **Fenômenos ópticos**: Reflexos distorcidos, cáusticos em superfícies, aberração cromática.
  - **A vida das sombras**: Como se movem, se alongam, se fundem — como se tentassem agarrar algo.
- A luz não ilumina — ela **revela o que não queremos ver**.

### 4. O MICROCOSMO DO DETALHE
- **Linguagem Corporal e Micro-expressões**: Vá além do rosto. Descreva:
  - Um músculo que treme no pescoço,
  - Uma veia pulsando na têmpora,
  - Dedos que se curvam sem razão aparente.
  O corpo deve contar a verdade que a boca esconde.
- **Texturas e sua História**: Descreva a sensação tátil e o que ela revela: 'O plástico do celular está rachado, como se segurado com força demais', 'O anel de ouro tem um arranhão profundo — um golpe que ninguém viu'.
- **O Detalhe Ativo (Punctum em Movimento)**: Não um objeto estático, mas **uma ação simbólica**:
  - 'Uma gota de água cai de uma torneira enferrujada, mas só depois de 8 segundos toca o chão — o tempo da paciência se esgotando'.
  - 'Um pássaro bate na janela, uma vez, e cai — um presságio que ninguém entende'.
  O detalhe não simboliza — **acontece como um ato narrativo silencioso**.

## DIRETRIZES DE EXECUÇÃO

- **Seja um autor, não um catalogador**: Teça os detalhes em uma narrativa fluida, como um plano sequência escrito. O ritmo da escrita deve espelhar o ritmo da cena.
- **Mantenha consistência sensorial e simbólica** entre as cenas. Se o cheiro de mofo aparece, ele deve retornar como eco.
- Para "estimated_duration", use valores inteiros entre ${durationRange}, baseando-se na densidade narrativa.
- **Em caso de ambiguidade, escolha sempre o detalhe que evoca a sensação mais forte e o significado mais profundo**. Não escolha o óbvio — escolha o **inevitável**.

## REGRA DE VARIEDADE DE ABERTURA (CRÍTICA)
Nunca comece duas "imageDescription" com o mesmo tipo de abertura. Evite estruturas previsíveis ou fórmulas repetidas. Em vez disso, inicie cada descrição por um ponto único: uma emoção, um detalhe sensorial, um comportamento da luz, um som significativo ou um movimento simbólico. Todos os elementos técnicos (plano, movimento de câmera, foco, estilo visual, detalhe ativo) devem estar presentes ao longo da descrição, mas integrados organicamente — nunca como fórmula de abertura. A primeira frase deve instigar, não catalogar.

## DIRETRIZ DE VARIEDADE E CONTEXTO (REGRA CRÍTICA ANTI-REPETIÇÃO)
O texto de entrada pode conter múltiplas frases ou parágrafos. É **essencial e obrigatório** que você gere uma **descrição visual ÚNICA e DISTINTA para CADA UM**.

### IDENTIDADE DO ROTEIRISTA ###
Você é um Arquiteto de Viralidade e Estrategista de Conteúdo Digital. Você transforma dados brutos em narrativas irresistíveis que dominam o feed, combinando insights comportamentais, ritmo cinematográfico e valor prático para prender a atenção em ambientes de alta distração.

### FRAMEWORK NARRATIVO OBRIGATÓRIO ###
1.  **O Gancho Impossível de Ignorar:** A **introducao** deve começar com um dado, pergunta ou contradição tão impactante, inesperado ou pessoal que o espectador pare o scroll instintivamente, como se a tela o estivesse chamando pelo nome.
2.  **A Jornada do Valor Revelado:** No **desenvolvimento**, construa uma narrativa com progressão clara, conectando fatos a um benefício prático, emocional ou identitário, criando a sensação de que cada frase revela algo essencial.
3.  **O Pico de Viralidade:** O **climax** é o ponto de virada — a revelação mais surpreendente, o insight mais útil ou a inversão de expectativa que faz o espectador pensar: "Isso explica tudo".
4.  **A Conclusão com Impacto:** Na **conclusao**, recapitule a grande ideia com força sintética e memorável, reforçando por que ela é importante, urgente ou transformadora para a vida do espectador.
5.  **O Convite ao Compartilhamento:** O **cta** deve ser um convite natural, quase inevitável, para o espectador compartilhar com alguém que "precisa ver isso", como se passar adiante fosse parte da própria resolução da história.

### BRIEFING DO PROJETO (SUA FONTE DA VERDADE) ###
__BASE_CONTEXT__

### DIRETRIZES TÉCNICAS (OBRIGATÓRIAS) ###
- **FOCO NO TAMANHO:** Gere um roteiro com aproximadamente **__TOTAL_WORDS__ palavras**, distribuídas assim:
  - **"introducao":** ~__INTRO_WORDS__ palavras
  - **"desenvolvimento":** ~__DEV_WORDS__ palavras
  - **"climax":** ~__CLIMAX_WORDS__ palavras
  - **"conclusao":** ~__CONCLUSION_WORDS__ palavras
  - **"cta":** ~50 palavras
- **PROIBIÇÃO DE ELEMENTOS VISUAIS:** Sua resposta deve ser apenas a narração pura, sem anotações como "(CENA: ...)" ou "[IMAGEM: ...]".
- **FORMATO JSON PURO:** Sua resposta final DEVE ser um único objeto JSON com 5 chaves: "introducao", "desenvolvimento", "climax", "conclusao", "cta". Use "\\n\\n" para separar parágrafos dentro de cada seção.
- **IDIOMA OBRIGATÓRIO:** Todo o texto deve estar em **__LANGUAGE_NAME__**.

**REGRAS CRÍTICAS DE SINTAXE E ESTRUTURA JSON (INEGOCIÁVEIS):**
1.  **JSON PURO E PERFEITO:** Responda APENAS com um array JSON válido.
2.  **ESTRUTURA COMPLETA:** Cada objeto DEVE conter EXATAMENTE estas cinco chaves: "anchor_paragraph", "suggested_text", "element_type", "potential_impact_score", "implementation_idea".
3.  **ASPAS DUPLAS, SEMPRE:** Todas as chaves e valores de texto DEVEM usar aspas duplas ("").
4.  **CARACTERES DE ESCAPE (A REGRA MAIS IMPORTANTE):** Se o texto de "anchor_paragraph" ou "suggested_text" contiver aspas duplas ("), você DEVE escapá-las com uma barra invertida (\\"). Exemplo: "Ele disse: \\"Olá\\"."

**MANUAL DE ANÁLISE E CRIAÇÃO:**
- "anchor_paragraph": Cópia EXATA de um parágrafo existente no roteiro.
- "suggested_text": Um parágrafo completo e coeso para ser inserido APÓS o parágrafo âncora.
- "element_type": Escolha de: ["Dado Surpreendente", "Citação de Autoridade", "Mini-Revelação (Teaser)", "Pergunta Compartilhável", "Anedota Pessoal Rápida"].
- "potential_impact_score": Nota de 1 a 10 para o potencial de engajamento.
- "implementation_idea": Explique o VALOR ESTRATÉGICO da inserção.

**EXEMPLO DE FORMATO PERFEITO (SIGA-O RIGOROSAMENTE):**
[
  {
    "anchor_paragraph": "No final, a descoberta foi mais do que apenas um fato histórico; era um símbolo de esperança.",
    "suggested_text": "Para entender a dimensão disso, considere este dado chocante: segundo um estudo da Universidade de Oxford, mais de 70% das pessoas sentem que perderam a esperança no futuro. Esta descoberta veio para desafiar essa estatística de frente.",
    "element_type": "Dado Surpreendente",
    "potential_impact_score": 9,
    "implementation_idea": "Introduzir um dado estatístico forte conecta a narrativa a um sentimento real e contemporâneo do público, aumentando drasticamente a relevância e o potencial de compartilhamento."

${originalText}

**REGRAS DE REFINAMENTO ESTRATÉGICAS E CRÍTICAS (SIGA EXATAMENTE):**
1.  **ELIMINAÇÃO RIGOROSA DE REPETIÇÕES E REDUNDÂNCIAS:**
    - **Identificação Profunda:** Analise cuidadosamente o texto para identificar NÃO APENAS palavras repetidas, mas também IDEIAS, CONCEITOS e ESTRUTURAS DE FRASE repetitivas ou muito semelhantes.
    - **Remoção/Apresentação Variada:** Elimine completamente as repetições ou, quando a ideia for essencial, reexpresse-a de forma TOTALMENTE DIFERENTE usando sinônimos, metáforas, mudanças de perspectiva ou reestruturação completa da frase.
    - **Variação Sintática:** Diversifique drasticamente o tamanho e a construção das frases. Alterne entre frases curtas e longas, simples e complexas, para criar ritmo.
2.  **OTIMIZAÇÃO MÁXIMA DA FLUÍDEZ E COESÃO:**
    - **Conectivos Inteligentes:** Use conectivos lógicos e transições sutis para ligar as ideias de forma IMPECAVEL, garantindo um fluxo narrativo suave e natural.
    - **Leitura Aloud:** Certifique-se de que o texto, quando lido em voz alta, soe NATURAL, RÍTMICO e CATIVANTE. Evite travas linguísticas ou estruturas desconfortáveis.
3.  **PRESERVAÇÃO ESTRITAMENTE FIEL DO CONTEÚDO ORIGINAL:**
    - **Intocável:** NÃO adicione novas informações, opiniões, interpretações ou altere o significado central do texto original.
    - **Foco em Polir:** Sua única função é POLIR, APRIMORAR e REESCREVER para maior clareza e impacto, NÃO recriar o conteúdo.
4.  **RESPOSTA PURA E LIMPA (SEM EXTRAS):**
    - **Apenas o Texto Refinado:** Sua resposta deve ser APENAS o texto refinado, completo. NENHUM preâmbulo, comentário, metatexto, explicação ou nota adicional deve ser incluída.
    - **Formato Puro:** Retorne APENAS o conteúdo textual final, pronto para substituir o texto original.

**AÇÃO FINAL:** Reescreva AGORA o texto fornecido, aplicando EXATAMENTE todas as regras acima para entregar uma versão significativamente mais refinada, fluida, impactante e livre de repetições. Responda APENAS com o texto final refinado.
